    # RegAn::Character.new(0x3a3) # Represents: Σ 
    # (Unicode GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA)
    # RegAn::Character.new(931)   # Also represents: Σ (931 dec == 3a3 hex)

    # RegAn::Character.new(?\u03a3) # Also represents: Σ
    # RegAn::Character.new('Σ')   # Obviously, represents a Σ

    # \xXX (hex)
